# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10th April, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Although I've been using GitHub for a while (mostly for more information on software I'm using) I've never had a repo. So this is a first.  

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
