# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10th April, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Although I've been using GitHub for a while (mostly for more information on software I'm using) I've never had a repo. So this is a first. I'm using 100 Days of Code to keep me on track with learning Python and R.

**Thoughts:** I don't fully understand GitHub, all of the terminology or structure, so need to get more familiar with this platform as well as coding!
