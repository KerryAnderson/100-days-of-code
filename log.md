# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10th April, 2019 (Preparation Day)


**Today's Progress**: Although I've been using GitHub for a while (mostly for more information on software I'm using) I've never had a repo. So this is a first. I'm using 100 Days of Code to keep me on track with learning Python and R.

**Thoughts:** I don't fully understand GitHub, all of the terminology or structure, so need to get more familiar with this platform as well as coding!

**Update:** Learned to update this log using Atom, commit and push to GitHub using the command line, and have everything set up for Day 1 of 100 Days of Code, starting tomorrow!

### Day 1: 11th April, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Carried on with Jupyter Notebook for building a rudimentary Customer Service Bot. Learned about pass statements, but not 100% sure I get everything that's happening. Got to Step 9, and code written to date can be found in [Python_Code](https://github.com/KerryAnderson/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Python_Code) folder (although it doesn't work yet).

**Thoughts:** Don't see yet how to build this bot outside of the notebook. Feel Codecademy shows the basics, but doesn't prepare you for real-life use of the languages, and feel they maybe dont't teach the most succinct/efficient use of code.

### Day 2: 12th April, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Carried on with Jupyter Notebook for building a rudimentary Customer Service Bot. Finished up, after almost pulling my hair out over a "reponse" instead of "response." Tired eyes after a day of STATA on a screen with brightness (unalterably) set to 100% brightness. Learned about the difference between use of return and print() statements when defining functions. Think I get it. Completed "creating and modifying lists in Python." Still not 100% sure with Git, need to do some more reading.

**Thoughts:** I learn much better working through a project (and struggling) than breezing through rigid, controlled tasks.
